# checkout-system
## Description
An ecommerce checkout-system for an Apple and Orange selling store that facilitates discounted and non-discounted checkouts. 
The store admin can activate a buy-1-get-1 offer on apple and a 3-for-the-price-of-2 offer on oranges.
When user clicks the checkout button, a list comprising the shopping cart is sent to the Flask powered backend and the required logic for determining cart cost fires to return the total cost.

#### The React framework was chosen to implement this project for the following reasons:
- React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
- It allows creation of a fast, simple and scalable frontend for web applications
- Using react allows for code reusability which is important as the project required an array of similar components in various areas.

### Development Aproach
An Iterative programming model was adopted, firstly laying out the individual components then updating them to meet the requirements further down the development lane.

### Programming paradigm
Choosing Procedural programming came in handy allowing for breaking down the programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
